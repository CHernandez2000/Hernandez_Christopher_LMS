# Hernandez_Christopher_LMS

This is a Library Management System (LMS) where the purpose to the code is to add a library book and remove a library book. My code is to add only sci-fi genre of books as a listed category to the library catalog and to remove one fantasy book from that catalog due to the fantasy book not fitting with the sci-fi category of books.
