This is a Library Management System (LMS) where the purpose to the code is to add a library book and remove a library book. My code is to add only sci-fi genre of books as a listed category to the library catalog and to remove one fantasy book from that catalog due to the fantasy book not fitting with the sci-fi category of books. The program works where I added up to 4 different sci-fi books where I came up an ID number for the books, putting the names of the books, and putting the authors names to the books they wrote. There is 1 fantasy book that also have the ID number I came up with, name of the book that is put in, and the name of the author who wrote the book put in. The adds and remove all come together to be displayed through the displayLibraryBooks method where it's only the sci-fi books that get displayed and not the fantasy book when running the code where the result shows. How the list being displayed works is due to the ArrayList Java utility used to correspond with another Java utility that is only called List, and from a function called "librarybooks" as a new ArrayList. There is an if statement followed by a while loop on the removeFantasyBooks public void method with a Iterator Java utility to express the removal of the fantasy book with system output print lines.
